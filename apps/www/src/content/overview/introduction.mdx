description: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Supports React, Vue, and Solid.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="item-content-1">
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawbacks of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
