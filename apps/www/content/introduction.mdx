title: Introduction
description: shipbase/ui is a set of high-quality, beautifully-designed, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Built on top of Ark UI and Tailwind CSS, it works with a wide range of JavaScript frameworks.

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library for a wide range of JavaScript frameworks.**

You know that most popular component libraries are designed to work with a specific JavaScript framework.

This approach works well until you need to work with different JavaScript frameworks, or you need to customize a component to fit your design system. 
**Often, you end up choosing a different component library, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**

This is the problem that shipbase/ui aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Framework-agnostic**: shipbase/ui components built on top of Ark UI work with a wide range of JavaScript frameworks, including React, Solid, Vue, and Svelte.
- **Composition**: Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.
- **Distribution**: shipbase/ui is inspired by shadcn/ui, and compatible with shadcn/ui's distribute system.
- **Beautiful Defaults**: Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.
- **AI-Ready**: Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.

## Framework-agnostic

Building UI components that work across different JavaScript frameworks presents significant challenges. 
shipbase/ui is built on top of Ark UI, which is built on top of Zag.js (a UI component library powered by Finite State Machines).

_With shipbase/ui, you can simply build apps using consistent components and APIs across different JavaScript frameworks._

## Composition

Every component in shipbase/ui shares a common, composable interface. If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.

_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You don't need to learn different APIs for every new component, even for third-party ones._

## Distribution

shadcn/ui has a code distribution system. shipbase/ui is inspired by it, and compatible with its schema.

_You can use shadcn/ui's schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on the existing structure._

## Beautiful Defaults

shipbase/ui comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:

- **Good Out-of-the-Box**: Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
- **Unified Design**: Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
- **Easily Customizable**: If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.

## AI-Ready

The design of shipbase/ui makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.

_An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design._
